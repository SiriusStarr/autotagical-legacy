This is *autotagical.moving*.

It contains the various functions used to generate file organization based on a
movement schema.

---------
Functions
---------
process_filter_level(tag_array, filter_level, tag_groups)
    Takes a file's tag array and a filter level and determines the contribution
    to path that it and all sublevels contribute by operating recursively.
generate_path(tag_array, movement_schema, tag_groups)
    Takes a file's tag array and determines how to organize it according to a
    movement schema.
determine_destination(file_list, movement_schema, tag_groups)
    Takes a list of files and processes how they should be organized in
    directories according to a movement schema.

    Takes a file's tag array and a sfilter level and determines the
    contribution to path that it and all sublevels contribute by operating
    recursively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file: AutotagicalFile
        An AutotagicalFile object, representing the file being moved.
    filter_level: dict
        A dictionary with strings for keys, representing a filter level.  It
        should have the following form:

        path: str
            The constructed file path from the current level down.  Empty if no
            matches whatsoever.
